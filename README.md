## Features 🚀

- **Real-time Label Detection:** Detects product labels in real-time using a webcam. 

- **Customizable Label Sets:** Choose between different label sets (e.g., Samsung, OnePlus, or all available labels) for inspection.

- **Pass/Fail Detection:** Displays whether all labels are correctly detected with "PASS" or "FAIL" status.

- **Dynamic GUI:** Built with customtkinter for an interactive and visually appealing interface.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes YOLOv5 for accurate and efficient object detection.

## Usage 📦

1. Run the `app.py` script to start the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Select a label set (All, Samsung, or OnePlus) using the dropdown in the GUI.

3. The webcam feed will show in real-time. The application will automatically detect and label items according to the selected set.

4. The status will update to "PASS" if all required labels are detected; otherwise, it will show "FAIL".

5. Press **'P'** to pause and resume the webcam feed.

6. Click **EXIT** to close the application.
